This Jhoola is tested with 40 lbs (18 kg) weight, which is twice the expected weight of the child in the Jhoola.  

## Background  
In southern Indian tradition, children are placed in a Jhoola (Hindi), Uyyaala (Telugu), or Thottil (Tamil) when they are 21 to 29 days old. It is an event for friends and family to visit and bless the child. The event also signifies the first time the baby sleeps away from the mother, letting the mother carry out other activities during the day while the baby enjoys a blissful sleep.  

For a baby, sleeping in a Jhoola in the first few weeks after birth has many advantages. The swing gives a womb-like experience, making the baby comfortable and at ease. The swinging sensations trigger a deep and instinctive relaxation, ensuring the baby gets a good sleep.  

Jhoola does have some disadvantages and risks. Please research and follow all the necessary precautions before placing your child in a Jhoola. I summarize the precautions at the end of this article.

## Quick Steps
Follow the below steps if you want to repeat what I did. Read detailed instructions to learn more about the culture and to understand the material selection rationale.  

1.	Drill a 1/2 in. hole at an appropriate location.  
2.	Insert the [Fliptoggle](https://www.homedepot.com/p/FLIPTOGGLE-1-4-in-x-2-1-2-in-Toggle-Bolt-2-Pack-425S/206347698){:target="_blank"}, push the toggle through the above hole, push the head to the ceiling, and break off the extra plastic. (Detailed instructions available on the package).  
3.	Place the [fender washer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-4-in-x-1-1-4-in-Zinc-Plated-Fender-Washer-804796/204632767){:target="_blank"} in the [Eye bolt](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-4-in-x-5-in-Zinc-Plated-Eye-Bolt-with-Nut-807166/204273493){:target="_blank"} and tighten the eye-bolt into the Fliptoggle.
4.	Loop the Saree through the Ring, and hold the ends together. Tie an [overhand Knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/overhand-knot){:target="_blank"} with both ends. Secure with one or two [square knots](https://www.animatedknots.com/square-knot){:target="_blank"}.  
5.	Connect the Quick Link, Extension Spring (optional) to the eye-bolt. 
6.	Attach the Ring with the saree to the extension spring or directly to the quick link.  
7.	Cut a 1/2 in. x 1.5 in. slot at each end of the wood. On either side of the slot, drill two 11/32 in. or larger holes. Place the wood at any desired height in the Jhoola and pass the saree through the slots. Pass a thread through the small holes and tie it to the saree.
8.	Load-test the setup. A 40 lb. / 50 lb. rice or wheat bag works best, as it weighs about the same as a 4.5 year or 5-year-old child.  


## Material Selection and Detailed Instructions  

### Install Eye bolt with nut and washer  
 Eye bolt with nut allows you to install the Jhoola in any section of the ceiling by using a drywall anchor such as the Fliptoggle. This option works best on the top floor of a building, where the ceiling is attached to roof trusses. Since roof trusses are spaced between 24 in. to 27 in. and can span 12 ft. to 24 ft., finding solid wood in an appropriate location can be challenging on the top floor. For lower-floor ceilings where it is easier to find a stud, fixing an Eye Lag Screw may be easier and more sturdy. Safe working load of the selected eye-bolt is 80 lb.  

   1.  Drill a 1/16 in. or 3/16 in. pilot hole in your preferred location to check if you are drilling into a joist/stud. If the pilot hole goes through a joist/stud, change the location and try again.  
   2.  In the final location drill a 1/2 in. hole.  
   3.  To install the Fliptoggle, bend the metal piece by applying force only at the joint. The plastic will break off by design if you forcefully bend at any other position.
        1. Push into the hole till it moves freely.  
        2. Pull down, so the metal bar sits flat on the drywall.  
        3. Push the Fastener head while keeping the plastic tight (do not bend the plastic).  
        4. Press Fastener head against the ceiling and break off the plastic.  

   4. Insert the washer in the bolt. Push the bolt into the fastener and tighten into the Fliptoggle.  

See [Cobra Anchors - Fliptoggle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4x58ZIqa6Q) to see the installation demo.

**Alternative** If you can find a joist (Solid wood) in the ceiling at the appropriate location, use an [Eye Lag Screw](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-4-in-x-3-3-4-in-L-Zinc-Plated-Lag-Thread-Screw-Eye-806916/204273856){:target="_blank"} with a pre-drilled hole. It is easier and sturdier than using a 5in. or larger drill bit. It is easy to find a stud on lower floors since those ceilings have studs running every 16‚Äù in both directions.  

**Options considered but not recommended**  

[Steel ceiling swivel driller hook](https://www.homedepot.com/p/COBRA-90-lb-White-Steel-Ceiling-Swivel-Driller-Hook-59908/202259541){:target="_blank"}  

  **Pros**: Easy to install. No drilling required. High safe load.  
  
  **Cons**: Some risk of swing coming off the hook during movement.  

[Toggle bolt fastener](https://www.homedepot.com/p/1-4-in-x-5-in-Zinc-Plated-Toggle-Bolt-with-Round-Head-Phillips-Drive-Screw-2-Pieces-817421/204273389){:target="_blank"}

**Pros**: Can be used with stud or on drywall. Comes in different lengths. 
**Cons**: Not recommended for overhead loads. Requires 5/8 in. drill bit, while most drill bit sets include bits up to 1/2 in. only  

See [Flip Toggle vs Toggle Bolt Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYsDrY7L3G8) to compare between the Flip toggle and Toggle bolt fastener.

### Assemble the Saree and Ring
 See video on the right for a demo.

1. Unfold the saree and let it fall freely.  
2. Hold the two ends of the width in each hand and slowly folds the ends into flat pleats towards the center. The flat pleats allow the saree to open fully at the bottom without twisting.  
3. Bring the other end of the saree and make a loop.
4. Push  the ring on one side.  
5. Holding the two ends together, about two feet from the end, tie an Overhand Knot.   
6. Take the split ends and tie or two square knots.  
7. Pull the ring next to the knot.  

### Hang the assembled Jhoola  
Attach the quick link, the spring, the Ring, and the saree to the eye bolt.

1. The 3/16 in. Quick Link opens wide enough to fit the 1/4 in. eye and supports up to 660 lb. Open the nut and slide the quick link into the eye.   
2. If using the Spring, slip the spring into the eye and tighten the nut. Skip this step if you are not using the spring.
3. Slip the Ring into the spring or the quick link. If attaching to the Quick Link, tighten the nut.

The basic Jhoola is now ready. Spread the saree and down to ensure the knots are tight. You could use this as-is or follow the next step to increase airflow.  

### Widen the Jhoola to increase airflow  
To allow free air movement, insert a 1/4 in. x 2-1/2 in x 2 ft. poplar board approximately midway to spread the saree. To ensure the wood does not slide, it is safer to cut a slot and few holes to tie the wood to the saree. You may use any other material that won't bend when pulled down. I prefer wood since it is light and sturdy.  

1. On each end drill two 11/32 in. holes about 0.6 in. from edge. These hole is just to tie a string to saree, so choose an appropriate size and location.  
2. At about 1-1/2 in. from each end drill a 1/2 in. hole in the center along width.  
3. Cut a slot from the edge to the 1/2 in. hole using either a handsaw or a universal cutting tool.  
4. File away any rough edges using a fine wood/metal file or 100 grit or finer sandpaper (optional).
5. Push about 6-8 in. of twine, wire twist, or a 28-gauge wire in each of the small holes.   


Position the wood at mid-point or according to convenience. Moving the it up will give a cozier feel and pushing it down will accommodate older kids.  

5. Slide the saree through the slots and tie the wood to the saree using the twine, wire twist or 28-gauge wire.

### Load Test
To load test place a heavy weight object which is at least twice the weight of the child. I used a 40 lb (~ 18 kg) rice bag and left in the cradle for three days - swinging it occasionally.

## Precautions  
Note: [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/features/baby-safe-sleep/index.html) that all babies sleep on their back on a firm surface. Please review the guidelines and the associated [recommendations of American Academy of Pediatrics](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/1/e2022057990/188304/Sleep-Related-Infant-Deaths-Updated-2022) and make wise decisions. These studies and recommendations are based on practices and cultural aspects of the majority in the United States.  

I recommend the following minimum precautions to be observed when using the Jhoola:  

1. USE a used cotton or silk saree. Both cotton and silk are breathable. Avoid silk sarees with [jari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zari), especially those with brocades. Traditionally silk saree is used for Jhoola only for event celebration, like the 21st day ceremony. Daily use cradles are mostly cotton sarees.  

2. Periodically test the Jhoola with a heavy object before placing the baby. ALWAYS test every time you tie a new know. Traditionally a [Rolu Potramu](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Rolu_patramu.jpg/512px-Rolu_patramu.jpg){:target="_blank"} - or pestle from a wet grinder is used for this purpose.  

3. DO NOT leave the Jhoola unattended. Periodically check that the baby has not turned. In joint families or traditional Indian deliveries which occur at the mother's parents' house, this is not a concern, since many people would share watching over the baby.  

4. DO NOT leave the baby sleep in Jhoola through the night. These were typically meant to be used during the day while mother takes on other chores.  
   
5. DO NOT place any other items in the Jhoola - no blankets or pillows. The Jhoola would adjust to the baby's sleeping position.
